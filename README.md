In one of the artifacts I uploaded, the gpiointerrupt file, I worked on implementing an SOS blinking system to the CC3220S via Code Composer Studio (CCS). While the flashing signals that were being sent were a little too fast for a proper SOS, I was able to make the CC3220S blink the lights in the SOS fashion. With some more time and tweaking, I would be able to fix the timing to make it a proper SOS. Looking back on this class, I really had to learn how to research independently of the course reading material and more times than I realized, I had to take a step back and think outside of the box when it came to the coding portions within CCS. This helped me to grow as an engineer and I want to take that with me when I work on new projects.
